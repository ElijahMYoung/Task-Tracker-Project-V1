I mainly struggled on trying to get the local stotage aspect working on the website. I ended up restarting a couple times and on my third version I ended up finding a youtube tutorial that showed how to do a task tracker with local storage and explained everything well. In the end I wasnt able to integrate fs into the project.
There were several times where I hit hard roadblocks where things should work but didnt, but as usual it was down to misplacing a parenthese or comma or capitalization.
